    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <div class="project">
      <h4>Project 1: Mouth Open-Close Detection Using Python and OpenCV</h4>
      <p>This project involved the use of Python and OpenCV for facial recognition and the detection of mouth open/close movements. The system was designed to allow users to control various devices, such as computers or home automation systems, by simply opening or closing their mouths. This project demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning and computer vision techniques to real-world challenges, creating an intuitive user interface and reliable detection algorithm.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h4>Project 2: Tongue Operated Wheelchair (Government-Funded)</h4>
      <p>This project, funded by the Government of India, is designed to provide enhanced mobility for individuals with severe disabilities. The wheelchair is controlled through tongue gestures, leveraging sensors to track the movement of the tongue and convert those signals into directional commands. This project is particularly significant as it combines medical technology with innovative hardware and software solutions to improve the quality of life for disabled individuals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h4>Project 3: Travel Website Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP</h4>
      <p>This web development project was aimed at creating a comprehensive travel website that allows users to browse and book travel packages. The front-end was built using HTML and CSS, while JavaScript was employed for dynamic content management, and PHP was used for server-side scripting to manage user requests and backend databases. The project enhanced my skills in full-stack development and the integration of front-end and back-end technologies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <h4>Project 4: Drone-Based Surveillance System for Port Areas</h4>
      <p>This project utilized drone technology to monitor vessels in port areas, detect encroachments, and assist with maritime security. The system involved developing custom flight control algorithms for drones, integrating real-time video streaming for surveillance, and implementing data processing tools to identify and report potential threats. The project gave me valuable experience in hardware integration, robotics, and data analytics in a highly specialized field.</p>
